# Movie Genre Machine Learning exercise

The intent of this exercise is to:

1. Choose a source of movie metadata that can be accessed through an API (Guidebox, TheMovieDb, other)
2. Obtain a large (=what?) set of movie metadata, critically including genres and descriptions
3. Train a machine learning algorithm to predict genre based on description
4. Build a light front-end to allow a user to try out the resulting algorithm
